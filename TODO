### TODO list

- wget is currently the only supported downloader. It might be handy to also have ftp, curl, and maybe others to be supported.
- Several languages support for i18n

- Tests definition and implementation

# Boot to add:
- UBCD would be great
- Partition Magic (or like) would be great too
* (may be a better idea to extract utilities from it and run them separatly because no PXE version is existing without huge modifications)

- Tool that could be used to generate pxe menu. Bad point is that it seem to be a remote only script using CGI...
