To use these Makefiles, you must deploy a tftp server binary (depending on your 
distribution). atftp or similar will do the job.
You must also configure your DHCP server to allow bootp protocol, fill in your 
"next-server" variable with the tftp server's IP address, and the boot file's 
filename to send as the boot binary for the PXE clients
