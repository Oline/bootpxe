- It may be interesting to split the starting to be huge Makefile in severals smallers Makefiles like:
  Makefile : only including one or many Makefiles.mk files.
  Distrib.mk : Makefile specific to a distribution
In that way, people would be able to control exactly which target are available by disabling the ability to install other OSes

- It might be interresting to propose either :
  - binary distribution of the pxelinux.0 file
  - compiling it (is that really useful?)
